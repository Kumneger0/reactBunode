## getStaticPaths Function

The getStaticPaths function in ReactBunode serves a similar purpose to generateStaticParams in Next.js, allowing you to pre-render pages statically at build time in combination with dynamic routes. It facilitates the generation of paths dynamically based on data fetched from an external source.

at build time. This function is particularly useful when you have dynamic routes whose paths depend on data that is not known until runtime.

## Purpose

The main purpose of getStaticPaths is to generate a list of paths for which pages will be statically generated at build time. These paths typically correspond to the dynamic parameters that your dynamic routes expect.

## Note

ReactBunode serves as a static site generator library. For dynamic routes, getStaticPaths must be exported from the route component. If getStaticPaths is not provided for a dynamic route, ReactBunode won't be able to generate the corresponding static route.

## Usage

```
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
	const products = (await fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products')
	.then((res) => res.json())) as
		| Array<Products>
		| undefined;
	return products?.map(({ id }) => ({ id }));
};




async function Page({ id }: { id: string }) {
	//rest code
}
```
