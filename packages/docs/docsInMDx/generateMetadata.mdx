## generateMetadata Function

The generateMetadata function in ReactBunode is designed to simplify the process of adding meta tags and manipulating the \<head> section of HTML documents. It allows you to dynamically generate metadata such as title, description, and Open Graph tags based on the properties of a product or any other entity.

## Purpose

The main purpose of generateMetadata is to generate metadata objects that can be used to enhance the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and social sharing capabilities of your web pages.

## Notes

React will automatically inject a title meta script and any other tag you add anywhere in JSX into the \<head> portion of the HTML
for more information see [react docs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components)

## Usage

The function signature typically looks like this:

```typescript
export const generateMetadata = async ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
	const product = await getProduct(id);

	return {
		title: product?.title,
		description: product?.description,
		openGraph: {
			images: [{ url: product?.image }]
		}
	};
};
```

# Metadata Object Export

In addition to using the generateMetadata function, ReactBunode allows you to export metadata directly as an object.

```
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title',
  description: 'Page Description',
  openGraph: {
    images: [{ url: 'image_url.jpg' }]
  }
};
```
