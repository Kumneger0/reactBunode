ReactBunode employs a file-based routing system In this section, we'll explore how to create them

## Creating a Route

To create a route, follow these steps:

1. **Create a folder:** Inside the app directory, create a new folder. The name of this folder will correspond to the URL path your route will represent (e.g., about for /about).
2. **Add page.tsx:** Renders content for the /about route.

## Dynamic Routes

ReactBunode supports dynamic routes, allowing you to capture variable parts of the URL path. Here's how to create and access them:

1. **Use square brackets:** Enclose a segment of the folder name within square brackets (for eg [id])
2. **Access dynamic value:** In the page.tsx file, you can access the dynamic value using a prop for eg id if your folder name is [id]

### Example

```

const MyDynamicPage = ({ id }) => {
return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is a dynamic page!</h1>
      <p>The slug is: {id}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyDynamicPage;

```
